# Wiki Workflow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/richfitz/ghwiki.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richfitz/ghwiki)

These are just personal scripts.  Information about the approach coming later, along with an example.

Run this from within a project that is a git repository.  The git repository must have a github remote, and the *first* remote that has a github url will be used.  The remote must *already* have a wiki.

Install with (from R)

```
devtools::install_github("richfitz/ghwiki")
```

Initialise with

```
Rscript -e "ghwiki::init()"
```

This will also clone the github wiki into a directory 'wiki' in the project root.  If the command failed (e.g., the wiki was not initialised yet),
pull down the project wiki manually with:

```
make wiki_clone
```

Add names of `R` or `Rmd` scripts to the file `.wiki_scripts`.  A template is generated by running the command above.  Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored, and whitespace is trimmed.  If `.md` files are added, they will be copied to the wiki, along with any figures named following the same conventions we convince knitr to follow.  At the moment, any file *not* ending with `.R`, `.Rmd` or `.md` is ignored, and duplicated lines will probably cause all sorts of mischief.

Run

```
make
```

to run all the scripts listed in `.wiki_scripts`, generating `md` files, figures etc.  A bunch of knit tweaks are applied to normalise figure paths, etc.

Run

```
make wiki_update
```

to update the local copy of the wiki repo, and


```
make wiki_publish
```

to push it up.  You're on your own with resolving conflicts.  Other make targets:

* `make clean` -- clean up generated .md and .Rmd files.
* `make wiki_rollback` -- undo a commit in the wiki repo
* `make wiki_reset` -- destructively clean up an unclean state in the wiki repo

Other commands can be run via `./.ghwiki`:

* `./.ghwiki reset_to <SHA>` -- move the wiki to a particular SHA (can undo a rollback this way)
* `./.ghwiki git [commands]` -- run git commands in the wiki repo (e.g., `./.ghwiki git log`)

And yet more commands via `./.scripts.sh`

* `./.scripts.sh list` -- list of scripts that we know about
* `./.scripts.sh base` -- basename of the scripts (without extension)
* `./.scripts.sh generated_Rmd` -- `Rmd` files that are candidates for deletion during cleanup
* `./.scripts.sh targets` -- list of `md` files that will be generated by `make`.

If you get fed up with typing `./.ghwiki` (which gets old fast) run

```
Rscript -e "ghwiki:::install_scripts('~/bin')"
```

which will install the scripts `ghwiki` into "~/bin" (assuming that it exists!).  If that is in your `$PATH` then you can run `ghwiki git log` and things like that.  Note that these scripts just redirect to the true scripts within the package, so can be left in place through package upgrades -- the scripts that are run are those in the package.
